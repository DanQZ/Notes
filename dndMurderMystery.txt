MURDER MYSTERY MINICAMPAIGN

    Setting: all within one very large city, the kingdom's capital.

    Plot: All your characters are part of an investigation guild. You guys are a team of highly trained operators, some of the best in the guild. A governor just issued your team a new, very important case.

    Background: All your characters became elite detectives due to your unusual skills. Each operator is only lvl 3, but you get 2 extra feats

    Recommended team composition: at least one of each

    **Spy**
        -the spy can go deep undercover and gather information from behind enemy lines, or break and enter a guarded building.
        -spy capabilities: deception, stealth, high maneuverability. High cha and dex
    **Investigator**
        -knowledge is power, and the investigator can find out anything about anyone with sufficient evidence. This character can reads emotions, create blackmail, predict movement patterns, etc.
        -investigator capabilities: investigation (duh), history/arcana knowledge, intimidation, high int and wis
    **Extractor**
        -when shit hits the fan, this character can bail out the others through various means
        -extractor capabilities: crowd control, maneuverability, distraction. High dex/str/whatever makes your character good at throwing people off the trail.

    General tips
        -Brute force will almost never be the answer. The city's guards and organized crime syndicates are trained and capable, and WILL be able to beat your team in a straight fight. 
        -You will run more often than you will fight.
        -Having negative dex is probably a terrible idea.
        -(house rule) Death is sudden and quick. Both an axe to the head or a knife in the back will both kill in one shot. Friend and foe.

    IMPORTANT: this campaign will require thought and foresight from the players. Character death will not be uncommon in poorly planned operations.
