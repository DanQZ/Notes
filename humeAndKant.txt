HUMEAN SKEPTICISM: what Hume is most famous for
    -problem of induction?
    -we need to be able to make judgements that our senses tell us a thing is that thing
    -we have complicated ideas that let us make thought, speech, elaborate ideas
    -what right do we have to ideas?
        -proper empyricist: right to concepts that can be traced to impressions
        -ideas have to pass the impressions test
    -there is some causation for interactions
        -causation is something in the world above the things that are causing and being affected
        -"events", "cicumstances", etc that might exist from nature of facts, state of affairs, etc.
        -Euthyphro: do they have attributes because they are like that, or do are they like that because they have attributes?
        -causation is predictable beacuse the things that are conjoined in the same way will yield the same result
    -human reason is not as powerful as we might think
        -why we haven't experienced certain things that seem essential to human condition
        -Bayle: similar, competing with the way to describe
