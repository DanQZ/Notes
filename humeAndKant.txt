Hume and Kant debate 
    -Kant moral views: reaction to Hume
    -Hume channels divide he sees in history of discussion
        -2nd inquiry: divide between those who think morality relies on sentiment vs those who think morality relies on reason 
    -naturalistic fallacy: treatice, just because things are natural does not mean they are right/moral/good 
        -no way to derive an "ought" statement from an "is" statement
        -a thing is a way, can't derive how things out to be
    -example: ways of preventing violent crime increase happiness in society 
        -being happy vs being happy in moral way
            -achieve moral way by answering if the way is just 
            -if cant answer, must find other ways of achiving happiness 
        -we can ignore if what we are doing is just if we can find other ways of achieving similar results that do not need to ask what justice is 
    -consequentialist: moral questions reducable to questions of happiness
        -A has better consequence than B, so A is right 
    -nonconsequentialist: A has better consequence than B, but are they being achieved in a moral way? 
        -moral happiness: acknowledging diff between happiness and morality, happiness and morality are both worth achieving but happiness =/= morality and can't be reduced to the other
    -50s: not only actions and motives, but also actors 
        -important that the people are good people despite actions and motives

Hume
    -in long debate with Kant
    -establishes paradigm that without, we would not have Kant
    -philosophy is only well done if it contributes to humanity at some level being better/ethical/wiser
    -early works: epistemology and human physics
    -because dialogues were published towards end of life, thought it was written teaching
        -in reality publishes history of natural religion early as 1750
        -creates new view of Hume, supposed to be most famous atheists in period where there are not many atheists
        -is he an atheist?
            -if he is not, makes dialogues concerning religion more interesting
    -naturalistic fallacy
        -thinking something is good because it is "natural"
        -we "ought" to be like this because it is "natural"
    
HUMEAN SKEPTICISM: what Hume is most famous for
    -problem of induction?
    -we need to be able to make judgements that our senses tell us a thing is that thing
    -we have complicated ideas that let us make thought, speech, elaborate ideas
    -what right do we have to ideas?
        -proper empyricist: right to concepts that can be traced to impressions
        -ideas have to pass the impressions test
    -there is some causation for interactions
        -causation is something in the world above the things that are causing and being affected
        -"events", "cicumstances", etc that might exist from nature of facts, state of affairs, etc.
        -Euthyphro: do they have attributes because they are like that, or do are they like that because they have attributes?
        -causation is predictable beacuse the things that are conjoined in the same way will yield the same result
    -human reason is not as powerful as we might think
        -why we haven't experienced certain things that seem essential to human condition
        -Bayle: similar, competing with the way to describe
