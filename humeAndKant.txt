Hume's Standards of Taste
    -Sentiments: all of them are right?
        -If you prefer one thing, it's because of some sentiments you have
    -there must be some combo of sentiments and judgements 
    -Homer, author of The Odyssey, incredibly popular back in rome and still popular, regardless of location, time, etc
        -massive accumulation of sentiment 
    -Example: beyonce
        -there is an attachment of taste that supports the opinion of beyonce 
        -such a weight behind the opinion, it makes it difficult to maintain negative opinion 
        -how much is just sentimental attachment?

4 Dissertations
    -1st book: Natural Religions 
    -4th dissertation: beauty in relation to taste

Natural religion 
    -1857: Europe having extended period of religious warfare
    -distinguished from revealed religion: natural religion has no books or dogma
    -natural religion revealed to us by reason alone 
    -does god exist? is god benevolent? etc.
        -natural religion is an idea that avoids religious strife
        -avoids dogmatic parts: there is no possibility of resolving disputes if there is dogma
    -faith not a lack of reason: only made possible through a certain species of reason
    -AS A WHOLE: trying to undermine the TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
        -world is so intricate and beautiful it is incredibly unlikely it was not designed
        -if it is designed, there must be a designer
        -the designer is god (?)
            -some think that this conclusion is arbitrary
        -teleological arg is entirely empirical
        -if someone were to build something very large (such as the universe), most likely would have a team 
            -implies multiple gods
        -the design is sometimes pretty bad though 
            -suggests the designer is pretty incompetent at designing things 
        -anthro god
            -child god? -> could be reason universe is so badly designed, because god is an incompetent and bored child 
            -senile god? -> also could be reason

Hume and Kant debate 
    -Kant moral views: reaction to Hume
    -Hume channels divide he sees in history of discussion
        -2nd inquiry: divide between those who think morality relies on sentiment vs those who think morality relies on reason 
    -naturalistic fallacy: treatice, just because things are natural does not mean they are right/moral/good 
        -no way to derive an "ought" statement from an "is" statement
        -a thing is a way, can't derive how things out to be
    -example: ways of preventing violent crime increase happiness in society 
        -being happy vs being happy in moral way
            -achieve moral way by answering if the way is just 
            -if cant answer, must find other ways of achiving happiness 
        -we can ignore if what we are doing is just if we can find other ways of achieving similar results that do not need to ask what justice is 
    -consequentialist: moral questions reducable to questions of happiness
        -A has better consequence than B, so A is right 
    -nonconsequentialist: A has better consequence than B, but are they being achieved in a moral way? 
        -moral happiness: acknowledging diff between happiness and morality, happiness and morality are both worth achieving but happiness =/= morality and can't be reduced to the other
    -50s: not only actions and motives, but also actors 
        -important that the people are good people despite actions and motives

Hume
    -in long debate with Kant
    -establishes paradigm that without, we would not have Kant
    -philosophy is only well done if it contributes to humanity at some level being better/ethical/wiser
    -early works: epistemology and human physics
    -because dialogues were published towards end of life, thought it was written teaching
        -in reality publishes history of natural religion early as 1750
        -creates new view of Hume, supposed to be most famous atheists in period where there are not many atheists
        -is he an atheist?
            -if he is not, makes dialogues concerning religion more interesting
    -naturalistic fallacy
        -thinking something is good because it is "natural"
        -we "ought" to be like this because it is "natural"
    
HUMEAN SKEPTICISM: what Hume is most famous for
    -problem of induction?
    -we need to be able to make judgements that our senses tell us a thing is that thing
    -we have complicated ideas that let us make thought, speech, elaborate ideas
    -what right do we have to ideas?
        -proper empyricist: right to concepts that can be traced to impressions
        -ideas have to pass the impressions test
    -there is some causation for interactions
        -causation is something in the world above the things that are causing and being affected
        -"events", "cicumstances", etc that might exist from nature of facts, state of affairs, etc.
        -Euthyphro: do they have attributes because they are like that, or do are they like that because they have attributes?
        -causation is predictable beacuse the things that are conjoined in the same way will yield the same result
    -human reason is not as powerful as we might think
        -why we haven't experienced certain things that seem essential to human condition
        -Bayle: similar, competing with the way to describe
