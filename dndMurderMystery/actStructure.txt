        -Syndicate splinter group turns out to also be working with Southern kingdom spies. They discover evidence of King's plot.

    -King is going to die soon from illness. His original plan was to try to correct Sussus' warmongering and cruel nature, because he did not have the time to spend with Sussus in the past when he was focused on making the Kingdom a better place

        Or keep Brug Ster as heir and build a peaceful prosperous future on a lie?
