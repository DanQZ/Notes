        -> Argument with Al Mualim, Al Mualim wants to preserve the guild by not leading a suicide crusade to spread the truth, Altair attempts to do so anyway. Got caught by Kingdom agents that were following him from the start because Altair is too dangerous to not keep track of.

ACT 3: Discovery the King is responsible for Sussus' murder 
    -Why did the King assassinate his own son and then condemn his second son to death for it? 
    -OBJECTIVE: QUESTION THE KING 

    People the king has connections with 
        -Nobility 
            -some confused
            -most 
        -Haytham 
            -told you all he knows 
        -Lucrezia 
            -desperately wants you to save Cesare 
        -Cesare 
            -in prison, can tell you the King did not listen to reason and was uncharacteristically tyrannical
        -Bayek 
            -Bayek: Enemy kingdom is planning a secret attack, ships hidden nearby if peace talks fail 
                -If expose the king, will have civil unrest. 
                -Cesare might overthrow Rodrigo, will not end war 
                -Generals will not listen to Brug, wants to keep Rodrigo in power.
                - 

    -King in his quest for justice and prosperity for his people made a deal with a devil: power and wisdom in exchange for his own life force and soul. It is now killing him sooner than he expected, before he had the chance to try and connect with Sussus and correct his warmognering path. 
    -The reason Sussus is cruel is because the King did not have the time to spend with Sussus in the past when he was focused on making the Kingdom a better place.
    -Ryze cannot heal the king but rather told the king through divinity magic that Brug Ster would make the most effective and kind king. Foresaw this as best possible outcome on average. 
    -King believed his first son, Sussus, was too much of a warmonger and cruelty 
    -King believes Caesar is selfish and would hurt the kingdom's people 
    -Third son is a very good person in comparison, would rule with kindness and justice 
    -The King as his final act tries to correct the course of history
    
    FINAL DECISION:
        Expose King and the truth and free Cesare? Allow a mediocre king who will make bad decisions in the future. Will continue war with Southern Kingdom, continuing bloodshed and siege on capital.
        
        Or keep Brug Ster as heir and build a peaceful prosperous future on a lie?
