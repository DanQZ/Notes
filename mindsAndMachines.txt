day 4

Situational perception 
	-sense where things can appear differently but we perceive it to be the same thing 
		-ex: a tree farther away looks smaller, but we can recognize it is still large 
		-ex: light on a white wall has different shades but we still can see the wall is white 
	-some conditions though we interpret it wrong 
		-pic of the dress: blue/gold or white/black because the lighting in the picture was right on the edge of what we can make out well 
	-piano played in concert hall vs on a streetside = we can tell it is a piano despite sound diff 

Variance in properties with perceptual conditions 
	-invariant: stable across changes
	-variant: alters with perceptual conditions
	-what properties are these though? 
		-properties of consciousness 
		-properties of environment 
	
								Invariant properties	variant properties 
external mind independent		intrinsic properties	perspectival properties
mind dependent					constancy properties	appearance properties 

Properties
	-intrinsic
		- 
	-constancy 
		-represenations of intrinsic properties, analyzed by our awareness of them
	-perspectival 
		-situation dependent
		-ex: location determines how much of fov it takes up
	-appearance
		-representations of situation dependent preperties, analyzed by our awareness of them

Dual aspect desideratum
	-explains that perceptual consciousness can be characterized by both variant and constancy properties

Range disideratum
	-explain external mind independent objects, events, can be perceived under a range of perceptual conditions, none of which can be called the "normal" condition		 

Primacy of Constancy Desideratum 
	-explains in some cases, perceptual systems  
		-other info here idk	

Consistency desideratum
	-perceptual content can be consistent despite both variatn and invariant properties in the same object in perceiver's environment
	-

Views
	-indirect realism 
		-we dont perceive objects directly
		-we perceive objects by other shit 
	-direct realists
		-we perceive environment directly 
		-no intermediate thing between us and stuff we perceive 
	-phenomenologists
		-all we have are how things seem to us 
		-how thing seem to us are a guide to how we should think about nature of theory of perception
		-we have more than how things seem to use (such as using science)

Framework
	-when someone is perceptually related to some perceptual properties:
		-metaphysics: what is nature of properties?
		-semantics question: what does a perceiver represent?
		-consciousness: what does perceiver experience?

Situation dependent properties 
	-perceptual conditions
		-features of environment that a mind-independent thing is presented
			-ex: location, lighting, color context, acoustic conditions

Do we have to be aware of perceptual conditions when representing a a situation-dependent thing?
	-no
	-can be aware of pull of gravity without being aware of exactly what it is
	-humans are bad at telling distance well, but very good at noticing if it is coming closer/going away
		-aware of situational properties (is changing distance), but not aware of perceptual conditions (distance of thing)

A uniformly white wall is illuminated by red light, and we might misperceive it to be intrinsically red. 
	-we perceive a situation-dependent property, but think it is an intrinsic property
	-

day 3

What is perspective?
	-typically involves processing info at location, space, and time

Egocentric perceptions
	-spectator POV as center of action

AI Training
	-machine learning algorithms
		-input -> extremely deep layers of neural links of the stuff in the input -> output
	-types of machine learning
		-supervised: task driven = tries to predict th next thing
			-distinguish between dogs and wolves: train off pictures of dogs and wolves
				-mistake: overfitting: learned if there is snow, it's a wolf. it's there's no snow, it's a dog
				-the mistake was caused by skewed picture data
		-unsupervised: data driven = identifies clusters of stuff
		-reinforcement: learn from mistakes = figure things out on its own
			-give positive reinforcement when it is doing something right
			-works well with emotional beings who can like things, such as food

Phases of AI (supervised)
	-model design
		-create task and goals, create data sets, model definition
	-training
		-learns probabilities between features and classifiers
		-dataset has a feature space =
	-validation
		-
	-model selection
		-
	-testing
		-image -> image features -> trained classifier -> prediction of what the image is

Subjective perspective
	-not only what we are aware of
	-includes unconscious things like presuppositions, unacknowledged motivations, etc
	-not all perspectives are equal: a doctor's perspective on a medical issue is more weighty than mine is

Types of egocentric info
	-episodic memory
		-what happened to me?
		-what did i do?
		-where did i leave my keys?
	-forecasting
		-what will i do next?
	-action/perception integration
		-using what you see to help you make actions: hand/eye coordination
	-audio/visual diarization
		-who said what and when did they say it?
	-social interaction
		-who is interacting with who?



------------------------------------------------------------

day 2

subjective perspective
	-1st, 2nd, and 3rd persion perspectives
	
	-do other animals have the same type of "perspective" as humans?
		-they must do things like represent its location: occupy the space they exist in

	-"perspective" includes at least these things: location, time, and some sort of psychological background
		-way we represent ourselves: many complex ways self-representation can exist
		-not just a mental state in some context
		-what determines subjective perspective vs the perspective itself
	
	-some facts are only accessed from sub pers
		-ex: colorblind person knows everything about colors, but has never seen colors.
			-is there something more to actually seeing colors?
			-question can only be answered from first person subjective perspective
	
	-are you conscious of your own subjective perspective?
		-most people think you aren't conscious of most things
		-conceptual vs nonconceptual

	-perspective vs relativism
		-just because people interpret the world from perspective, doesn't mean reality is relative to their perspectives
		-there exist objective things such as math: "2+2=4"
		-can you adopt someone else's perspective?
			-huge amount involved, other's circumstances, experiences, etc.
		-all of above are separate questions


-first person perspective
	-locked into our own perspectives
	-statements that include "indexicals" such as "i", "here", and "now" are only true relatively

-"de se" content
	-types of self representation
	-what does "conceptual" mean?
		-conceptual: "specific and intelligent info?"
			-mental representations
			-stereotypes
			-functional roles: 
			-inferential roles: "'red' means color, not green, it is not a noun, etc."
		-nonconceptual: "unspecific and abstract info?"
			-image-like representations: 
			-map-like representations: 
		-why perceptual content is nonconceptually structured
			-unintelligent animals have perceptions but not concepts -> perceptual content cant be conceptually structured
				-they can see things but not draw external conclusions and info from these things

	-Peacocke's 3 levels of "de se" content
		-degree 0 "de hinc" AKA "here" content
			-does not represent self beyond occupying space you exist in (rocks and water and stuff?)
			-
		-degree 1 nonconceptual de se content
			-represent self but not aware of self (unintelligent life, bacteria, bugs?)
			-thoughts without thoughts about self: "Im thirsty" -> does not need concept of self
		-degree 2 conceptual de se content
			-thing has some sort of concept of self (intelligent life: humans, dolphins?)
	
	-"here content" AKA "de hinc" AKA "degree 0" content
		-map with no labels
			-no info about where you are
		-map with an unlabelled dot on it
			-no info about where you are
		-map with a dot labelled in a non-indexical way such as "pog"
			-know where "pog" is but not where you are
		-map with a dot labelled "here"
			-know where the map is?
		-map with a dot labelled "me"
			-know where you are

-ownership levels?
	-physical
		-raw info and interactions
	-information processing/algorithmic
		-how to interpret physical, such as pain and stuff
	-mental state
		-experience the pain
	
-self location
	-"here" content without de se content
	-primitive representation where higher levels are grounded
	-implies consciousness without requiring self-consciousness:
		-something can experience pain without bein aware it is experiencing pain

-accuracy conditions
	-what does it take for something tobe accurate?
	-here content: location of subject and environment determine accuracy conditions
		-"there is an apple" -> nothing is relevant besides location
	-de se content: subject itself affects conditions
		-person 1 says "i see apple" is true if person 1 sees apple
		-person 2 says "i see apple" is true if person 2 sees apple

-where to draw the line between self and not self?
	-is nervous system part of self?
	-there are parts of cognitive processing we do not access, evolutionary instincts and stuff
